# OpenShift 4.6 UPI Deployment with Static IPs

Deploy OpenShift 4.6 and later using static IP addresses for CoreOS nodes. The `ignition` module will inject code into the cluster that will automatically approve all node CSRs.  This runs only once at cluster creation.  You can delete the `ibm-post-deployment` namespace once your cluster is up and running.

**NOTE**: This requires OpenShift 4.6 or later to deploy, if you're looking for 4.5 or earlier, take a look at the `pre-4.6` [branch](https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-vmware/tree/pre-4.6)

**NOTE**: Requires terraform 0.13 or later.

## Architecture

OpenShift 4.6 User-Provided Infrastructure

![topology](./media/topology.png)

## Prereqs

1. [DNS](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.6/installing/installing_vsphere/installing-vsphere.html#installation-dns-user-infra_installing-vsphere) needs to be configured for external cluster access.
    - api.`cluster_id`.`base_domain` points to `openshift_api_virtualip`
    - *.apps.`cluster_id`.`base_domain` points to `openshift_ingress_virtualip`
    - Point both of those DNS A or CNAME records to your LoadBalancers
2. [CoreOS OVA](http://mirror.openshift.com/pub/openshift-v4/dependencies/rhcos/) must be uploaded to vCenter as a template.

## Installation Process

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ibm-cloud-architecture/terraform-openshift4-vmware
cd terraform-openshift4-vmware
```

Update your `terraform.tfvars` with your environment values.  See sample `terraform.tfvars.example` file for details

```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
```
